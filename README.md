# Predicting breast cancer using machine learning
This repository contains source code for a data exploration project which explored various machine learning techniques to ultimately predict malignant or benign breast tumours.

## Dataset
The data for this project can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29

## Skills
This analysis relied heavily on using R packages for machine learning and compared trees compiled using CART and C4.5 techniques.  The influence of balanced class design was also explored for each algorithm.

## Summary
  * This tutorial explored two decision tree algorithms, CART and C4.5, to help predict whether a breast mass was benign or malignant. 
  * Ultimately, the C4.5 balanced class design decision tree produced the highest accuracy and lowest false negative rates. 
  * The C4.5 balanced tree highlighted the largest concave point of the cell nuclei as the most influential predictor for tumour outcomes in this dataset.
